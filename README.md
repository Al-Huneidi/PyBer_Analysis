# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze rideshare data from January 2019 to early May 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO.

## Resources
city_data.csv
PyBer_ride_data.csv
ride_data.csv

## Overview
1. Import your data into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. Merge your DataFrames.
3. Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for each city type, including urban, suburban, and rural.
4. Create a bubble chart that showcases the average fare versus the total number of rides with bubble size based on the total number of drivers for three city types.
5. Determine the mean, median, and mode for the following:
	- The total number of rides for each city type.
	- The average fares for each city type.
	- The total number of drivers for each city type.
6. Create box-and-whisker plots that visualize each of the following to determine if there are any outliers:
	- The number of rides for each city type.
	- The fares for each city type.
	- The number of drivers for each city type.
7. Create a pie chart that visualizes each of the following data for each city type:
	- The percent of total fares.
	- The percent of total rides.
	- The percent of total drivers.

## Overview

Create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. In addition to your scatter and pie charts, she would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Part 1 Instructions

1. Create a PyBer Summary DataFrame.
2. Create a summary DataFrame that showcases the following for each city type:

- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

Final Summary DataFrame:


### Summary of Dataframe

## Part 2 Instructions

Create a Multiple-Line Plot for the Sum of the Fares for Each City Type.

- Plot the sum of the fares for each city type so that your final line chart:


- Create a pivot table:
